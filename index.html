        <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Istanbul_panorama_and_skyline.jpg" >
        
        <p>Istanbul is incredible. It’s one of the most awe-inspiring cities we’ve been to thus far. Home to breathtaking architecture, delicious food, and some of the warmest, most genuinely hospitable people we’ve ever met on our travels, it’s a city we would love to visit again and again.</p>

If you’re looking to visit Istanbul for the first time, then I hope this comprehensive travel guide can help you plan your trip. It will tell you everything you need to know from where to stay, which sights to see, and of course, what food to eat.

We enjoyed Istanbul so much that we could honestly see ourselves living there. Spend just one day in this captivating city and I won’t be surprised if you feel the same way too.

<h2>Best time to visit Istanbul</h2>

<p>Spring (<strong>March-May</strong>) is the best time to visit Istanbul, followed by Autumn (<strong>September-November</strong>). Crowds are thinner and the weather is moderate during both seasons, though Autumn sees more rain than Spring. We went in early November and the weather was near perfect. I was comfortable walking around in a light jacket with just a t-shirt inside. It was overcast on a couple of days but it never rained.<br>
<br>
Fans of tulips — which are originally from Turkey, not Holland — will be pleased to know that the International Tulip Festival is held in April with millions of tulips in bloom throughout the city.<br>
<br>
<strong>MAR-MAY:</strong> This is the best time to visit Istanbul. The weather is relatively mild and dry and the city will be awash with color. The next time we visit Istanbul, it will definitely be in April to take part in the tulip festival.<br>
<br>
<strong>JUNE-AUG:</strong> Apart from being the busiest time of the year, June till August can get pretty hot and humid — up to 28°C/82°F. Lines are at their longest and prices at their peak during this time.<br>
<br>
<strong>SEPT-NOV:</strong> Like Spring, Autumn is a great time to visit Istanbul. The weather is similar although it does get rainier in the Fall as described. While Spring has the Tulip Festival, Autumn has its share of festivals as well like the Akbank Jazz Festival and the Istanbul Theater Festival, both of which are in November.<br>
<br>
<strong>DEC-FEB:</strong> December till February is low season in Istanbul. It’s the wettest and coldest time of the year so be sure to dress appropriately. It can get rainy and snowy with temperatures dropping down to a frigid 3°C/37°F.<br>
</p>

<h2>Things to do in Istanbul</h2>

<h3>1. Visit Sultanahmet’s Top Tourist Attractions </h3>
<p>As described above, Sultanahmet is home to the city’s most important attractions like Ayasofya, Topkapi Palace, the Basilica Cistern, and the Blue Mosque. No first-time visit to Istanbul can be complete without visiting all these places. </p>
<p><strong>Ayasofya:</strong> The most iconic site in Istanbul and once considered the greatest church in Christendom.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sultanahmet:</strong> One of the most striking mosques in Istanbul.<br> 
<br>
<strong>Basilica Cistern:</strong> The largest surviving Byzantine cistern in Istanbul.<br>
<br>
<strong>At Meydani:</strong> The former location of the Hippodrome of Constantinople.<br>
<br>

<h3>2. Shop like a Sultan at the Grand and Egyptian Spice Bazaars</h3>
<p><em>The Grand and Egyptian Spice Bazaars</em> are Istanbul’s most popular bazaars. One of the largest and oldest covered markets in the world with over 3,000 shops, you can buy all sorts of things at the Grand Bazaar like leather goods, jewelry, carpets, clothing, furniture, ceramics, and souvenirs.<br>
<br>

<br>


Considerably smaller than the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Bazaar is home to around a hundred shops selling dried fruits, nuts, spices, tea, Turkish Delight, and other goodies. Both are walking distance from Sultanahmet Square.</p>

<h3>3. Walk Across Galata Bridge and Explore Beyoğlu and Dolmabahce Palace</h3>
<img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Galata_bruecke.jpg">

<p>Home to the iconic Galata Tower and Dolmabahce Palace as well as the city’s most fashionable boulevard in Istiklal Caddesi, the neighborhoods across Galata Bridge provide an interesting mix of old and new that’s different in feel to the time-honored charm of Sultanahmet. If you enjoy shopping, good food, and perhaps a taste of Istanbul’s nightlife, then this is where you need to be.</p>

<p><strong>Galata Bridge:</strong> Bridge connecting the north and south of European Istanbul.<br>
<br>
<strong>Galata Tower:</strong> Former watchtower offering great views of the city.<br>
<br>
<strong>Istiklal Caddesi:</strong> The heart of Beyoğlu and Istanbul’s most famous street.<br>
<br>
<strong>Dolmabahce Palace:</strong> The biggest palace in Turkey.</p>

<h3>4. Take a Cruise on the Bosphorus with Şehir Hatları</h3>

<img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bosphorus_Bridge.jpg">

<p>Going on a scenic all-day cruise of the Bosphorus is one of Istanbul’s greatest pleasures according to many. They’re right. Şehir Hatları is Istanbul’s official ferry company and offers three Bosphorus Cruises — Full, Short, and Moonlight (Evening). The Short Cruise takes you on a two-hour loop while the Full and Moonlight Cruises last for six hours and take you all the way to Anadolu Kavağı, which is the last dock before the Black Sea. It’s a charming seaside town where you can have a delicious seafood lunch or dinner by the water. </p>

<h3>5. Marvel at the Mosaics in Chora Church</h3>
<img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KariyeCamii-Aussenansicht.jpg">
<p>Compared to other attractions, Chora Church is out of the way but it’s worth the effort. A small Byzantine church converted to a mosque before being turned into a museum, it’s home to what many call the most stunning mosaics in Istanbul.</p>

<h3>6. Go on a Culinary Walk</h3>
<p>Turkish cuisine is interesting. It’s colorful and nuanced and seems as diverse as the country’s landscape.</p>

<h3>7. Explore the Trendy Asian Side</h3>
<p>With the majority of tourist attractions located on the European side, most first-time travelers to Istanbul don’t venture into the Asian side of the city. </p>

<p>Home to a maze of cafes, bars, restaurants, and some trendy neighborhoods, the Asian side has much to offer and is well worth a day if you can spare it.</p>
